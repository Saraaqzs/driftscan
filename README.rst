====================================
Cylinder Radio Telescope Simulations
====================================

This is a Python project for simulating the performance of cylinder radio
telescopes such as CHIME.

Installation
============

This project has a few dependencies: `Numpy <http://scipy.org/>`_ and `Matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.sf.net/>`_ which are usually either installed, or easy to
install; and the python binding for Healpix, `healpy
<http://code.google.com/p/healpy/>`_ which is marginally more involved (see
instructions on the site).

You'll need to place this directory in your python module search path, for it to
run the scripts correctly. This can be done by::

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"/<path>/<to>/cylinder_simulation"
